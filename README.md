# PanpsBot ðŸ¤–
## Description
PanpsBot is a project that I started to work on at my beginning .NET days and I used to learn new technologies and libraries.
It's a Discord Bot client running on an Amazon EC2 machine under a Docker container.
It has a few functionalities that use some libraries that I had to work on in real job projects.
